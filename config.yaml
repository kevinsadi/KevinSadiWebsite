    content: |-
      I'm currently a student at Georgia Tech advised by Greg Turk in his generative AI and graphics lab. I'm investigating novel ways to procedurally generate 3D terrain.
      Aside from research, I make games with friends in Unity, UnrealEngine 5, and my own handmade game engine, Kek3D.

      For fun, I gig jazz drums around Atlanta with different groups. I also love some Volleyball or Climbing.
