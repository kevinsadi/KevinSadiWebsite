# My Portfolio Website / Blog

I've wanted to have a blog for quite some time. However, the inner webdev in me wouldn't settle for anything less than perfect, which resulted in me never starting the project. 
Eventually, I decided that I should just start and make something so people can see what I'm working on and I could also start publishing blogs about all the cool stuff we're doing in Greg Turk's lab.
This is that project.
