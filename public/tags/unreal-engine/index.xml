      <description>Honestly, I was a bit surprised when I embarked on creating a third person shooter how little literature there is on how to properly implement a third person hitscan firing weapon aside from working through an entire course. However, I think the general idea of it is really easy and geometrically satisfying. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into it.
C++ or Blueprints? Either way, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be explaining the theory behind how this works so you can implement it in any system.</description>
