[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I was a bit surprised when I embarked on creating a third person shooter how little literature there is on how to properly implement a third person hitscan firing weapon aside from working through an entire course. However, I think the general idea of it is really easy and geometrically satisfying. Let\u0026rsquo;s jump right into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"c-or-blueprints\"\u003eC++ or Blueprints?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be explaining the theory behind how this works so you can implement it in any system. I chose to do so in C++ so I will show it in that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/blogs/tempimagelol.png","permalink":"https://kevinsadi.github.io/KevinSadiWebsite/blogs/markdown-syntax/","title":"Third Person Hitscan Firing Systems"}]
